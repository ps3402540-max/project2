# IceCream — Demo Static Site

This is a small single-page demo ice cream website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — interactivity (cart, persistence)

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with).
2. Click flavors to increase quantity and "Add" to add to cart.
3. Open the Cart to see items; the cart persists via localStorage.
